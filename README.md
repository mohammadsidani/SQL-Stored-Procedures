# SQL-Stored-Procedures
Learn about SQL Stored Procedures with the help of examples. Learn how to create and use SQL stored procedures to reuse your code and improve the performance of your database.

In SQL, a stored procedure is a set of statement(s) that perform some defined actions. We make stored procedures so that we can reuse statements that are used frequently.
Stored procedures are thus similar to functions in programming. They can perform specified operations when we call them.

## Creating a Procedure

Create stored procedures using the CREATE PROCEDURE command followed by SQL commands.
